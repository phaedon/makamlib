An open source library for Ottoman-Turkish makam

Merhabalar! 
The goal of this project is to create a structured data set with a complete description of the theoretical details of Ottoman-Turkish makam, the modal musical system of the eastern Mediterranean. We hope this will provide a useful foundation for anyone seeking to build applications for education, composition, or real-time performance.
